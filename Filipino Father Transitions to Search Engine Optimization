Yes! You heard it right, I am a Filipino father transitioning and learning search engine optimization. Last 2021, in the middle of the year our office announced that there will be some employees who will be affected by the redundancy. I was one of those who got affected by our organization’s transition period.

Because of the COVID 19 pandemic, many Filipinos lost their jobs due to financial issues of companies, organizations and businesses. Many that I know of resorted to freelancing and virtual assistance jobs. This is where I became aware that digital platforms exist wherein you can apply for a job. You are the employee and you can choose a client. Certain keywords were always appearing on these platforms. Like “virtual assistant”, “freelancing”, “SEO specialist”, “Graphic Designer” and many more.

Search engine optimization is one of those words that I got hooked on. According to an article, it is one of those in-demand jobs. Here is the article if you like to check it out. As a Filipino father who grew up in confined culture and mindset when it comes to working. It challenged me to add another skill that I think will be beneficial for my personal growth and providing skills to other people. I decided that while I am still currently looking for a permanent source of income, might as well spend my time learning the sphere of search engine optimization.

I found very few communities Facebook page for SEO here in the Philippines. Very few posts for a week appear. As for me, I am eager to learn and transition from my previous skills to being a SEO specialist here in the Philippines. I am not a technical person but I am learning from the in-depth course that I enrolled with. I believe that getting out of your comfort zone will certainly give you a benefit in the long run.

If you are interested to know what is search engine optimization and its scope. Feel free to check this youtube video and article.
